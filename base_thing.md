that the version in mac is `2` for the system service, so we can not mind it.

maybe we just alias it, but I will be upset on it cause someday I long time not in using python I always forget it.

so, 2 is 2 , 3 is 3.

please checkout your .bash*** file some word writting `alias python = 'python3'` stupid words to do not I did before.

### check by  `--version`

firstly,  run cmd check   `python --version`  , `python3 --version` and `pip --version`. Or even `pip3 --version`

you will see the relation of pip and python, from the  `pip(pip3) --version`, it will display the python version which contecting. 

there is a cmd check how many `python` in you machine but I forgot, hovever, the way you find then if redundancy version you thought just delete it.
