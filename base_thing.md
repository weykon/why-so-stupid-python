that the version in mac is `2` for the system service, so we can not mind it.

maybe we just alias it, but I will be upset on it cause someday I long time not in using python I always forget it.

so, 2 is 2 , 3 is 3.

please checkout your .bash*** file some word writting `alias python = 'python3'` stupid words to do not I did before.
